Approach of Solving the Problem
I used a hybrid pipeline that combines deep learning and traditional machine learning techniques. The key idea was to use a pre-trained ResNet18 model from PyTorch as a fixed feature extractor by removing its final classification layer. The output from this CNN model was high-level feature vectors for each image. These features were then used to train a Random Forest classifier. I applied 5-fold stratified cross-validation to ensure robustness and evaluated model performance using the macro F1-score. After validating performance, I retrained the model on the entire training set to generate final predictions.

Challenges Faced
1. The test images were not publicly available during development, which made it harder to validate generalization.
2. Extracting features for over 1,000 high-resolution images using ResNet18 was computationally expensive and time-consuming.
3. Balancing between CNN feature extraction and traditional ML pipeline tuning without a validation leaderboard.

How Did You Overcome the Challenge?
1. To ensure generalization despite the lack of test data, I relied on robust cross-validation using StratifiedKFold.
2. I optimized the feature extraction loop using batch processing and efficient data loaders.
3. Multiple experiments were conducted with different random seeds and hyperparameters to validate consistency and avoid overfitting.

Final Observation and Leaderboard Score
The hybrid approach proved effective. The model achieved an average macro F1-score of 0.955 across cross-validation folds, indicating high and balanced performance across all soil types. Final predictions were submitted successfully using a well-formatted CSV file.
